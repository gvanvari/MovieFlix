STRIDE-based security and threat review:
---

### Spoofing
- **Authentication**: Users are authenticated via a method matching email and password (`findUserByEmailAndPassword`). However, passwords appear to be stored in plain text in the database (`User` entity’s `password` field).
    - **Risk**: Storing plain-text passwords means attackers gaining DB access can immediately impersonate users.
    - **Mitigation**: Always hash (e.g., bcrypt) and salt passwords before storage. Never store passwords in plain text.

---

### Tampering
- **User and Movie CRUD**: All data modifications (create, update, delete) are handled via ORM (EntityManager). There’s little evidence of input validation or integrity checks in repository/service methods.
    - **Risk**: Lack of input validation or resource-level access control may allow unauthorized tampering or privilege escalation.
    - **Mitigation**: Validate all user inputs (not just types, but lengths, allowed characters, etc.) and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive operations.

---

### Repudiation
- **Logging/Auditing**: There is no evidence of logging user actions or maintaining audit trails for modifications, access, or failed authentication attempts.
    - **Risk**: Users could deny having performed certain actions, and admins cannot trace malicious behavior.
    - **Mitigation**: Implement server-side logging for all user actions, especially for authentication and data modification. Use audit tables if necessary.

---

### Information Disclosure
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: The code exposes user records including emails and (plain-text) passwords via queries and possibly API endpoints.
    - **Risk**: Any leak (e.g., via logs, error messages, or API responses) could expose sensitive user information.
    - **Mitigation**: Never transmit or expose passwords. Mask sensitive fields in API responses and sanitize error messages.

---

### Denial of Service
- **Resource Exhaustion**: There is no evidence of pagination, query throttling, or rate-limiting on API endpoints (e.g., `findAllUsers`, `findAllMovies`).
    - **Risk**: Attackers could request large datasets or flood endpoints, exhausting server resources.
    - **Mitigation**: Always paginate large data responses and implement rate limiting (e.g., per IP/user).

---

### Elevation of Privilege
- **Role Management**: The `User` entity contains a `role` field, but there is no visible enforcement of user roles (e.g., only admins can modify movies/users).
    - **Risk**: Any authenticated user may perform privileged actions, such as creating/deleting movies or users.
    - **Mitigation**: Enforce RBAC in controllers/services—check roles before allowing sensitive actions.

## Critical Recommendations

1. **Hash and Salt Passwords**: Never store plain-text passwords.
2. **Input Validation**: Add strict validation on all user inputs.
3. **RBAC Enforcement**: Check user roles before allowing privileged actions (e.g., user/admin).
4. **Add Logging/Auditing**: Track and log all sensitive actions.
5. **Paginate and Rate-limit Endpoints**: Protect from resource exhaustion.
6. **Never Expose Sensitive Data**: Avoid sending passwords/emails in API responses.
